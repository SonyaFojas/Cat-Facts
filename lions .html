<h1> Lions </h1>

 

<p> Lions often travel in families so they can catch food easier and be together, A lion is male and a Lioness is female. You can tell if theyre male or female because if one has a big mane its a lion, if its a lioness it wont have a mane. Lion babies are called cubs and there are usually 2-3 cubs born. Lions are at the top of thefood chain because they are predators, there prey are sometimes cantalope, birds, foxes, badgers and etc. when people think of lions they usually imagine them in hot desserts but there are different types, such as mountain lions, Mountain lions live in forested mountains, you can spot some in california at night,and they are close to the size of a grown adult human.</p>
